A revamping of my Jump and Shoot Unity game
Here are old gameplay videos from the previous projects: 
* [January 2015](https://youtu.be/hmyeGGlsQhs)
* [May 2015](https://youtu.be/VRhT5tukZp4)

TODO: Add useage/installation or a good standard README for Unity projects.

## GOALS

* [ ] Change the mechanic so that shooting a target breaks it open and then you hit a key to rapidly dash into where the target was to gain a new jump
* [ ] Add a new gun pickup/dialog/pickup system
* [ ] An X-shaped muzzle flare for the new gun
* [ ] With the gun incorporate a better visual jump bar system (hexagonal barrel of new gun)
* [ ] Possible rotating halves of a ring for a in game 3D mesh reticle?!
* [ ] Octahedron bullets and light source only on the muzzle flare not on bullets
* [ ] (Make new hand monsters + Warren Oates)
* [ ] Make more goals...
